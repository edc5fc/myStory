## Chapter 1: The Disaster

Starting from April 18, 2103, Catherine Rosella's life was miserable. 
Although she had plenty of friends and was generally liked, Catherine fell victim to an insanely powerful stab in the back that even she, one of the cleverest students in Altia, could not have avoided. It all started on that fateful day at 8:55 AM, when an email popped up on Catherine's 	wristphone which told her to go to the principal's office. 

When she arrived, Catherine saw her framer, her nemesis that was forever haunting her, the unseen, unthought of enemy: the renowned liar, Juliana Fornax. Juliana was the type of troublemaker that nobody wants to get caught by. A natural gossiper, Julie (as she was popularly known) spread rumors like a torch setting off a wildfire. She also employed a deadly technique- "fake logic". Fake logic is a chain of seemingly genuine statements that lead to, in actuality, the initial argument proposed by the liar being always correct. The fake-logic user continually adds details that adapt to the opposing party's counter-statements, which is why, in fact, fake logic isn’t valid. But even if you know and say that another person is using invalid logic, your opponent still has an advantage. This is precisely what happened when Catherine and Julie engaged in a verbal battle. Julie claimed that Catherine had ransacked her locker, and Julie used the surveillance camera photos to prove it. Catherine retaliated, saying that Julie altered the camera files (as Julie was also a very good hacker). After a few rounds of back-and-forth shouting, Catherine pointed out that Julie's logic was unsound. However, that made Julie even more forceful. After 20 minutes, Catherine was so steaming that she would’ve punched Julie in the face, had the principal not been there. Nevertheless, the debate ended in stunning victory for Julie and shocking defeat for Catherine. The principal told Catherine that she was isolated for 5 weeks. "Lost," Catherine muttered to herself, fuming and breathless. "Lost."
